# Low Latency lab 🔎

Repository dedicated to experiments and research on low-latency systems.

- [SoA-vs-AoS](soa-vs-aos/README.md) - Experiment comparing Structure of Arrays (SoA) vs Array of Structures (AoS) memory layouts.
- [SIMD](simd/README.md) - Experiment comparing SIMD optimizations for processing lottery entries, building on the SoA-vs-AoS experiment.
